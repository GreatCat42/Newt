# Newt Piecewise -- Child Project of Simple Bot

Based on a scatter-plot graph, the main program code in this project returns a piecewise function (quadratic or linear) that can describe the relationship between two values.

## Keywords: Slope K, Section, Weighted, Distance, Scatter-plot

## 1 Calculate the k-x relationship by Avg. and the 'difference by difference' method

```
```



## 2 Find linear expressions for every x and k' when k'/16k<sub>0</sub> is an integer

```
```



## 3 Get smooth quadratic pieces with distance, weighted Avg and expressions from 2

```

```



## 4 Combine. Done.

```
