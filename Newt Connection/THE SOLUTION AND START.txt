So... This part of the project is started for a simple reason:

Say, A CANNOT trigger C alone
And neither does B.

A =x= C
B =x= C

But if A and B happens at the same time
or very close to each other,
there will be a great chance of triggering C.

AB ==> C

So instead of thinking angrily with isolated
A, B and Cs(Like the S.B.Newt did), we can
'merge' A and B, thinking as if they are one
individual event

The project will focus on the problem and solution
above and improve Newt's Algorithm
