So... This part of the project is started for a simple reason:

Say, A CANNOT trigger C alone
And neither does B.

A =x= C
B =x= C

But if A and B happens at the same time
or very close to each other,
there will be a great chance of triggering C.

AB ==> C

The project will focus on the issue above
and improve Newt's Algorithm
